//this program is to understand the various types of the variable
"use strict";//this tells that we are using syntax of the newer version
// we can also avoid this nowdays it is automatically considered to be done

// alert("How are You !");//this through error because of here we are using node here not a browser
console.log("Rajneesh verma");
console.log("Chandigarh University")

//Note-> we have to write a code which is more readable be a good practice to write a code

let name="Rajneesh verma";//string data type
let age=19;//number datatype
let isGood=true//boolean datatype

//Note->various primitives datatype
//1.Number-for number 
//2.Bigint - for greater number which is out of the range of the number datatype
//3.string - to store like name or sequence of character
//4.Boolean - for two values either true/false
//5.null -> it is a standalone value
//6.undefined ->when we only decalre a varaible without any value
//7.symbol -> when we talk about the uniqueness of the values

//object - most well known quantity of the js

//Note -> typeof()- is the funtion to know about the different types of the variable like

//imp- the type of the 'null' datatype is 'object'. and 'undefined' datatype is 'undefined'.
console.log(typeof("Rajneesh"))//we can find directly by using the value
console.log(typeof(null))//it print the object
console.log(typeof undefined);//it print undefined
console.log(typeof isGood)
